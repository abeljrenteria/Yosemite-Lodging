# Yosemite-Lodging
This project was created out of the frustration of trying to book lodging in the Yosemite valley. I created a python script that utilizes the Selenium package to create a bot that navigates to the booking webpage for Yosemite and checks if a specified date is available and if so an email is sent to notify me to book.
